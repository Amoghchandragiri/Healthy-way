As part of our collaborative project during Construct Week at Masai School, we developed a full-stack nutrition tracking website inspired by Cronometer. In just 5 days, our team of 4 developers created an authentication system, landing page, and dashboard for tracking nutrition with a focus on enhancing the user experience. We worked hard to ensure that the website was functional and aesthetically appealing, and incorporated our own unique ideas and designs into the project.
